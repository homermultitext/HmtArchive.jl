# Commentary


```{julia}
using HmtArchive.Analysis
current_release = hmt_cex()
```




All commentary indexing in the HMT archive is organized in a single collection, so we can confidently take the first (and only) of the set of commentaries retrieved by the hmt_commentary function.

```{julia}
#| warning: false
using HmtArchive, HmtArchive.Analysis
commentary = hmt_commentary(current_release)[1]
```

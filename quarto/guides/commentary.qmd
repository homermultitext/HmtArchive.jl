# Work with scholiastic commentary


We've read the contents of a current HMT project release into a variable named `current_data`.
```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| output: false
parentdir  = pwd() |> dirname |> dirname |> dirname
srcfile = joinpath(parentdir, "hmt-archive", "releases-cex", "hmt-current.cex")
current_data = read(srcfile, String)
```


All commentary indexing in the HMT archive is organized in a single collection, so we can confidently take the first (and only) of the set of commentaries retrieved by the hmt_commentary function.

```{julia}
#| warning: false
using HmtArchive, HmtArchive.Analysis
commentary = hmt_commentary(current_data)[1]
```

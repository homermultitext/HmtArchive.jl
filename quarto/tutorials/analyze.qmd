# Work with a published release of the HMT project archive


To work with the contents of the HMT project archive, use both the `HmtArchive` and `HmtArchive.Analysis` modules.

```{julia}
using HmtArchive, HmtArchive.Analysis
```

The HMT project archive is published in delimited-text files following the CEX format.  You can instantiate any of the contents of the archive from one of these published sources.

The current published release is always available at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/homermultitext/hmt-archive/master/releases-cex/hmt-current.cex`. The function `hmt_cex` is a utility that downloads the current release and reads it into a single string. Verify what release you're using with the `hmt_releaseinfo` function.

```{julia}
src = hmt_cex()
hmt_releaseinfo(src)
```

## Example of getting contents: texts


```{julia}
textcatalog = hmt_textcatalog(src)
```

```{julia}
normalizedtexts = hmt_normalized(src)
```

```{julia}
diplomatictexts = hmt_diplomatic(src)
```
